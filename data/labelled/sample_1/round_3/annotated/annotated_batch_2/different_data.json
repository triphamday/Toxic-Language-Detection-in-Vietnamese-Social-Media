        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses the term 'sgay' which is a deformation implying 'gay' and is used in a derogatory tone. The emojis 😇🫰🏻 also signal mockery and ridicule, targeting LGBTQ identity.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The comment appears to be a list of names followed by informal expressions like ':)))' and 'sgay:))😇🫰🏻'. While 'sgay' may be a deformation potentially referencing 'gay', it is used in a context that does not clearly mock or attack LGBTQ individuals — instead, it seems to be casual or playful in tone. There is no explicit or implicit insult directed at any individual or group, and no derogatory intent can be confirmed. Emojis like 😇🫰🏻 do not convey mockery.
