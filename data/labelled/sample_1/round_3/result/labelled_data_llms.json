However, it does not target a specific individual, group, or identity with the intent to侮辱 or demean. The speaker uses self-reference ('tao là minh chứng') to illustrate a personal viewpoint or experience. While highly informal and sexually explicit, the language serves as hyperbolic expression of opinion about workplace trust, not a personal or group attack. Thus, under RULE A (profanity alone ≠ TOXIC) and RULE B (opinions with strong language ≠ TOXIC without targeting), it is classified as NON-TOXIC.",
