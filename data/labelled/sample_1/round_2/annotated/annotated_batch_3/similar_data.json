        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment contains the phrase 'no homo,' which is a derogatory slang term often used to mock or dismiss LGBTQ identity, even if it is used in a seemingly humorous context. This is a form of coded wording that implies an attack, making the comment TOXIC.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'no homo' is used in a mocking and sarcastic way, combined with 'mẹ m đã' which implies a personal attack. The structure and context suggest derision toward LGBTQ identity, using coded language to demean. This falls under the LGBTQ-related toxicity rule (RULE C), as it uses implicit, teasing wording to mock non-heteronormative behavior."

The comment uses this term in a patronizing and sarcastic manner ('cần được yêu thương để có thể sớm giác ngộ'), implying that these people are living in 'ảo giác', which is a demeaning characterization.
