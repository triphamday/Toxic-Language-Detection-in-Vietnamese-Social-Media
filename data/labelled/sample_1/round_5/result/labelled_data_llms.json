Cụm từ 'hành động giống con thú' khi nói về người nghèo ở Ấn Độ mang tính miệt thị và thiếu nhân văn. Ngoài ra, câu hỏi 'ở VN có được lấy 4 vợ không?' được đặt ra với giọng điệu châm biếm, hàm ý chế giễu luật lệ và văn hóa của các quốc gia khác, đồng thời ngầm đề cao Việt Nam một cách thiếu khách quan. Điều này có thể gây phản cảm và kích động sự phân biệt đối xử.",

Mặc dù có sử dụng cách diễn đạt mạnh như 'người ta hành động giống con thú', nhưng đây là biện pháp tu từ để nhấn mạnh hoàn cảnh nghèo đói, không nhằm xúc phạm trực tiếp cá nhân hay nhóm. Không có ngôn ngữ miệt thị, chế giễu hay tấn công cá nhân, và có dẫn chứng so sánh để đặt câu hỏi xã hội. Tính chất là tranh luận xã hội mang tính phê bình xã hội, không mang tính chất độc hại.",
