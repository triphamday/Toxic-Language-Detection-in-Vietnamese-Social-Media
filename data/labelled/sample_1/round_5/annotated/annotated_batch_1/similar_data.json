        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text 'chiều quá n d á' appears to be a phonetic or slangy way of writing 'chiều quá nhỉ dạ', which is a soft, possibly ironic or teasing expression meaning 'too gentle/lenient, right?' or 'being too nice, huh?'. While 'n d á' might be a playful or distorted spelling, there is no clear target, insult, profanity, or harmful intent. The tone could be teasing but not abusive, disrespectful, or targeting a group/individual with hostility. Without further context suggesting mockery or negativity, it leans toward casual, colloquial speech rather than toxic language."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text uses the phrase 'đi tàu nhanh', which in Vietnamese internet slang is a euphemism for death or suicide, often used in dark humor or mocking contexts. Directing this at an individual with 'chớ kẻo lại' implies a veiled threat or encouragement of harm, making it emotionally negative and disrespectful.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses a dismissive and mocking tone ('đừng có đi tàu nhanh chớ kẻo lại') to imply that Phạm Đức Việt is incompetent or prone to failure, which is a form of indirect insult. The phrase suggests ridicule, especially if 'tàu nhanh' is a metaphor for hasty or reckless actions, making it emotionally negative and disrespectful.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The comment uses a double entendre with 'đi tàu nhanh' (literally 'take a fast train'), which is a slang phrase in Vietnamese that can imply anal sex, often used to mock or insinuate someone's sexual orientation in a derogatory way. Combined with the warning tone and naming a specific person (Phạm Đức Việt), it constitutes a personal, implicit insult with homophobic overtones, making it toxic."

By stating 'thực tế rất rất nhiều' (in reality, very very many), it implies negative stereotypes and perpetuates discrimination based on lifestyle, contributing to a hostile or demeaning tone even without direct insults.",

The tone is aggressive and disrespectful, reinforcing negativity and hostility. The statement also implies skepticism or ridicule toward statistical data, which can be seen as dismissive and provocative.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'bay lắc đẫy vào' uses slang associated with drug use ('bay lắc' means to get high), which promotes illegal and harmful behavior.
