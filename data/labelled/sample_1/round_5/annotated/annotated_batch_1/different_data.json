        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text 'con quốc halo chưa' appears to be an informal or slang-based query likely related to the video game Halo, possibly asking if someone has played it or is familiar with it. There is no indication of insults, hate speech, profanity, or negative targeting. The tone is neutral and casual, without any implicit toxicity or cultural sensitivity issues that would make it harmful or disrespectful.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'con quốc halo' is a derogatory deformation of 'con quốc' (a pejorative term for someone from a rural or less educated background) combined with 'halo' (likely referencing the Halo video game franchise, but used here to mock or infantilize the target). The tone is mocking and demeaning, implying the person is unsophisticated or foolish.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'con quốc halo' is a phonetic mockery of 'con Quốc khái', likely referring to someone named Quốc with a derogatory tone. The use of 'halo' (as 'hello') distorts the name in a childish, mocking way, commonly used in online toxicity to ridicule individuals. The structure 'con [name]' without context can be insulting in Vietnamese, implying disrespect or belittlement."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text comments on having dimples, a generally positive physical feature, in a lighthearted and playful tone with a laughing emoji, showing no hostility, disrespect, or negative targeting.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses the word 'eo' (a slang term often implying 'skinny' or 'small' in a mocking way) combined with 'cũng có lúm má' (also has dimples), which can be interpreted as sarcastic or mocking toward someone's appearance. The emoji 😂 further emphasizes the mocking tone, making it disrespectful and demeaning.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The comment points out a physical feature (dimples) humorously, but there is no clear intent to insult or demean. The emoji 😂 suggests light-heartedness rather than mockery. In Vietnamese context, mentioning 'eo' (waist) with dimples is often associated with attractiveness, so the tone is likely playful or complimentary."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Câu 'nhìn môi sợ quá' là một lời nhận xét chủ quan, thể hiện cảm xúc cá nhân (sợ hãi) về một đặc điểm ngoại hình. Nó không chứa ngôn từ xúc phạm, lăng mạ, mỉa mai, hoặc nhắm vào một nhóm người cụ thể. Đây là một biểu đạt cảm xúc tiêu cực nhẹ, nhưng không mang tính công kích, đe dọa, hay tạo ra sự thù địch.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment 'nhìn môi sợ quá' directly targets a person's appearance (specifically their lips) in a negative and exaggerated way ('sợ quá' implies extreme disgust or fear). This constitutes an appearance-based insult, which is disrespectful and emotionally negative.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The statement 'nhìn môi sợ quá' (scared just looking at the lips) expresses a personal reaction, possibly due to unusual appearance or makeup, but does not contain profanity, insults, or targeted mockery. Without context implying ridicule or derogatory intent, it remains a subjective, non-aggressive observation."

It does not target any individual or group, lacks offensive, abusive, or discriminatory content, and maintains a neutral to positive tone without sarcasm or negativity.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'nhìn cuốn ko' is a phonetic approximation of 'nhìn củn quá' or 'nhìn củn củn,' which is a derogatory way to describe someone as short or stumpy. The tone is mocking and targets a person's physical appearance, making it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'nhìn cuốn ko mn' translates to 'looks attractive/engaging, right guys?' and is used to express admiration or interest, likely in a visual or entertaining context. It uses informal slang ('cuốn' meaning captivating, 'mn' = mọi người), but does not contain insults, profanity, mockery, or targeting of individuals or groups.

It maintains a respectful and neutral tone.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses playful teen-code ('chj' for 'chị', 'cđm' for 'cộng đồng mạng') and a lighthearted tone (☺️). It expresses a casual, non-aggressive sentiment ('thôi ạ' = 'alright', implying mild resignation or humor) without targeting anyone negatively or using profanity, slurs, or mockery. The context suggests teasing or banter rather than toxicity.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'cđm' is a common Vietnamese teen-code abbreviation for 'con đ* mẹ' – a vulgar and aggressive profanity. Although presented with a smiling emoji, the use of this swear word in a mocking or dismissive tone ('thôi ạ', 'chị không sợ mà cđm sợ') introduces hostility and disrespectful language, making it toxic despite the superficially playful tone."

Biểu tượng cười ':))' cho thấy tông giọng vui vẻ, tự trào, không nhắm mục tiêu xúc phạm cá nhân hay nhóm nào. Đây là cách diễn đạt thông thường trong cộng đồng game thủ.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses 'kobuko' (a pig-like creature in gaming) to indirectly insult someone's appearance, implying they resemble a non-human or unattractive figure. The playful tone (' :)) ') does not negate the derogatory implication, which is a form of appearance-based mockery.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The term 'kobuko' refers to a non-human, pig-like creature in games, often used as a derogatory nickname. 'Roll mãi không thấy' implies actively hoping to encounter this character, suggesting the speaker views someone as resembling this ugly creature. The smiley ':))' adds mockery, indicating insult disguised as joke."

While not overtly profane, the tone leans toward inappropriate flattery with implicit objectification, which can be considered toxic in certain contexts, especially if unsolicited or directed at someone in a non-consensual manner.",

Trong văn hóa nói chuyện thân mật của giới trẻ Việt, cách nói này thường xuất hiện trong các tương tác vui vẻ, không đi kèm dấu hiệu độc hại như từ lăng mạ, miệt thị hay biểu cảm chế nhạo (emoji 😂 hay 😱). Do đó, dù có yếu tố cường điệu, câu này không vượt ngưỡng thành ngôn ngữ độc hại."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment 'chị ăn ít lại điiii' literally means 'Sister, eat less, please' and is expressed in a playful, exaggerated tone (with multiple 'i's for emphasis). It does not contain insults, profanity, or mockery. While it comments on eating habits, it is not inherently toxic unless used in a specific context to shame someone, which is not evident here. The tone appears lighthearted rather than hostile.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The comment 'chị ăn ít lại điiii' uses an exaggerated, mocking tone (extended 'i' at the end) to imply the person is eating too much or is overweight, which constitutes a body-shaming remark. In Vietnamese online culture, such phrasing is commonly used to tease or insult someone's appearance, especially regarding weight, making it a form of indirect but toxic personal attack."

Mặc dù đề cập đến ngoại hình, lời nói này không chứa ngôn ngữ lăng mạ, đe dọa, kỳ thị hoặc có ý gây hấn rõ ràng. Trong ngữ cảnh giao tiếp thông thường của giới trẻ Việt Nam, đây có thể được hiểu là một lời bình luận mang tính hài hước nhẹ nhàng hơn là một lời công kích độc hại.",

This is a body-shaming remark, which constitutes a form of appearance-based insult. While subtle, it carries a derogatory tone often used to ridicule someone's physical appearance, especially in online teasing contexts.
