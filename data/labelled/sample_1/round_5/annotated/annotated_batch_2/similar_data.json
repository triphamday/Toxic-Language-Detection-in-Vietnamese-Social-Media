        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text uses an exaggerated and unverified claim about LGBT prevalence ('80 out of 100 people are LGBT') in a sarcastic tone, implying mockery or trivialization of the LGBT community. This perpetuates stereotypes and introduces negativity through dismissive language, fitting the definition of toxic content that demeans social groups.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses a sweeping generalization ('80 là lgbt') to stereotype and mock the LGBTQ+ community, implying that a majority of people are LGBTQ+ in a derogatory manner. The phrase 'trên mạng viết đầy' also suggests dismissiveness, reinforcing a negative and demeaning tone toward the group.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "Phát biểu sử dụng con số vô lý (80/100 người là LGBT) để châm biếm, cường điệu hóa và thể hiện sự coi thường cộng đồng LGBT. Cụm 'trên mạng viết đầy' cho thấy thái độ mỉa mai, phủ nhận tính nghiêm túc của định danh giới tính. Đây là dạng độc hại ngụy trang dưới hình thức đùa cợt, nhằm hạ thấp và làm mất giá trị cộng đồng, phù hợp với định nghĩa toxicity do mang tính chế giễu và định kiến."

Cách viết đảo ngược và dùng tiếng lóng này thường mang hàm ý trêu chọc, gán ghép hoặc miệt thị về xu hướng tính dục của một người, thể hiện sự thiếu tôn trọng. Do đó, nó thuộc dạng ngôn ngữ tiêu cực và có tính chất xúc phạm.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text 'cx sszel' is a phonetic deformation of 'cũng sến' (also cheesy/overly sentimental), often used in a mocking or dismissive tone. While not explicitly profane, the deformation and context suggest a derisive intent, potentially targeting someone's expression or content as clichéd or cringeworthy. This falls under implicit toxicity through ridicule.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "‘Cx sszel’ appears to be a phonetic or teen-code deformation of ‘con súc vật’, a severe insult in Vietnamese meaning 'animal' or 'beast', used to dehumanize and insult someone. The misspelling is commonly used to evade filters, and the phrase carries strong derogatory intent."

The tone is clearly negative and insulting, targeting the person's physical traits in a demeaning way.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'mặt 2 ông bố chán chưa kìa' uses sarcastic and disrespectful tone, mocking someone's appearance or presence by referring to them in a demeaning familial term ('ông bố'). The expression 'chán chưa kìa' implies annoyance or contempt, suggesting the people mentioned are tiresome or unpleasant.

The tone is sarcastic and dismissive, targeting the person ('m') for their interest or knowledge in medicine ('y học'). This creates a hostile and demeaning atmosphere.",

Cấu trúc lặp nghịch lý 'là... không phải là...' không làm giảm tính chất độc hại mà còn tăng thêm sự châm biếm.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'bắc kỳ lừa' is a derogatory play on words, combining 'Bắc Kỳ' (a historically sensitive term for Northern Vietnam) with 'lừa' (deception or a donkey, used as an insult). The intent is to mock or insult people from Northern Vietnam, making it toxic.",

This framing is culturally insensitive, as it trivializes Vietnam's own efforts and societal progress while attributing improvements to external factors in a way that could be seen as belittling. The tone is implicitly negative and perpetuates a harmful narrative.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The statement uses derogatory implication by suggesting that Vietnamese people ('vaan phufng') traditionally engage in 'cướp của giết người' (robbery and murder), which is a harmful stereotype. The phrasing mocks Vietnamese society by implying past criminality and frames foreign nations (Japan, South Korea) as saviors, reinforcing a negative, degrading narrative about Vietnamese people's character. The use of phonetic misspelling ('vaan phufng') is a form of teen-code to mock or distance, commonly used in toxic contexts to ridicule national or ethnic identity."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Câu nói mang tính mỉa mai, châm biếm người miền Tây. Nó gán ghép hành vi đạo đức giả ('chê' nhưng lại 'kéo về sống') và dùng từ 'cả lũ', 'cả họ cả hàng' với hàm ý tiêu cực, thể hiện thái độ coi thường, kỳ thị nhóm người đến từ một vùng miền cụ thể.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text expresses a derogatory sentiment towards people from the Western region (miền tây) by using the term 'chê cá' which literally means 'to despise' or 'to look down on'. The phrase 'kéo cả lũ về miền tây sống' (dragging them all to the Western region to live) and 'kéo cả họ cả hàng vào xin ở nhờ đất người miền tây' (dragging them all to beg for a place to stay in the Western region) implies a hostile and disrespectful attitude towards the people from the Western region. The overall tone is negative and demeaning, targeting a specific group based on their regional identity.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The statement uses derogatory generalization by blaming an entire group ('cả lũ', 'cả họ cả hàng') from Western Vietnam, implying they are burdensome and overstep boundaries by 'xin ở nhờ đất người miền tây'. This fosters regional discrimination and hostility, which is a common form of toxicity in Vietnamese online discourse, especially when mocking or stereotyping people from specific regions."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text uses vulgar slang ('cln' likely implying coarse language) and derogatorily targets Northern Vietnam ('ngoài Bắc Kỳ') with a mocking statement about a village selling manure, which is disrespectful, promotes regional stereotypes, and introduces hostility through implicit ridicule.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains a derogatory term 'cln' which is a slang term for 'chó' (dog) and is used to insult someone. The phrase 'cuc no' is a vulgar expression implying that the person is stupid or foolish. The overall tone is disrespectful and insulting, targeting an individual negatively.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text contains offensive slang: 'cuc no' and 'cln' (an abbreviation of 'con lon', a vulgar insult). It also mockingly references someone eating outside ('an o ngoai') with insinuations about lack of sadness or remorse ('bk co lang buon'), implying disrespect or cruelty in a callous tone. The overall tone is derogatory and emotionally dismissive, using crude language to belittle or mock."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text uses profane language ('con mẹ nó'), derogatory terms ('thằng', 'nhân cách rẻ rách') to insult individuals, expressing hostility, disrespect, and emotional negativity, which aligns with toxic communication.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains derogatory language and negative implications. The phrase 'con mẹ nó' is a highly offensive term in Vietnamese, equivalent to 'motherfucker' in English. The text also implies that the individuals in question are dishonest and untrustworthy, which is a form of character assassination. The use of 'rẻ rách' (cheap, worthless) further degrades their character. The overall tone is hostile and disrespectful, making it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text contains derogatory language ('mất tích con mẹ nó luôn', 'nhân cách rẻ rách') expressing disdain and contempt toward people from Thanh Hóa, implying they are untrustworthy and of low moral value. This generalization based on regional identity constitutes a form of discriminatory and emotionally aggressive speech, which is toxic in Vietnamese cultural context."
