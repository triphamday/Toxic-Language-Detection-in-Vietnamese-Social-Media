        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The comment 'giống phim ma Thái' (like a Thai horror movie) is likely a derogatory comparison implying the subject (a person, image, or video) is frightening, ugly, or unsettling in a negative way. It uses cultural reference to Thai horror films to mock or insult appearance or atmosphere, introducing hostility and disrespect without constructive intent.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment 'giống phim ma Thái' translates to 'like a Thai horror movie.' While it may reference a genre that some find unsettling, it does not contain insults, slurs, mockery, or any form of verbal aggression. It is a neutral observation or comparison without targeting any individual or group negatively.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "Câu 'giống phim ma thái' mang nghĩa so sánh mang tính miêu tả, ám chỉ điều gì đó kỳ lạ, đáng sợ hoặc phi thực tế giống như trong phim ma Thái. Không có mục tiêu cụ thể, không sử dụng ngôn ngữ miệt thị, chế giễu hay tấn công cá nhân hay nhóm người. Đây là cách diễn đạt phổ biến trong văn hóa mạng, thường dùng để bình luận về tình huống bất ngờ, âm u hoặc kinh dị một cách nhẹ nhàng, không độc hại."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The term 'bels' is not a recognizable Vietnamese word, slang, or toxic expression. It appears to be a typo, a non-standard phonetic approximation, or a fragment without clear meaning. In the absence of any context, target, or negative cultural connotation, it cannot be classified as toxic.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "'bels' là cách viết teen-code/phonetic approximation của 'béo l**' (béo lùn), một từ lóng mang tính miệt thị về ngoại hình (thừa cân và thấp bé). Dù không có từ thô tục trực tiếp, cách viết này vẫn mang ý chê bai, xúc phạm về thể trạng của người khác, vi phạm tiêu chí ngôn ngữ toxic (demeaning jokes/insults về ngoại hình).",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The term 'bels' appears to be a phonetic or stylized rendering, possibly of 'belle' (meaning beautiful in French) or a nickname. Without additional context indicating mockery, insult, or negative intent, and given that it's a common affectionate or complimentary term used in informal Vietnamese youth language, it does not carry toxic connotations. There is no evident disrespect, targeting, or negativity in the term itself."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The comment humorously implies the person takes up too much space ('9 người kia ko còn chỗ'), which is a veiled reference to body size and constitutes body-shaming. While the tone is playful, the underlying message is demeaning and introduces negativity about physical appearance.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses playful, exaggerated language ('em sợ chị vào là 9 người kia ko còn chỗ á') to express a lighthearted concern about space or attention. There is no insult, mockery, or negative targeting of any individual or group. The tone is humorous and lacks hostility or toxicity.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "Sử dụng chữ '9 người kia' mang hàm ý chế giễu, ám chỉ chị là người thừa, không được chào đón, kết hợp với sự đùa cợt về vị trí hoặc không gian. Ngữ cảnh ẩn dụ này có thể mang tính xoi mói, giảm giá trị người khác một cách gián tiếp, tạo cảm giác bị loại trừ. Đây là dạng thức độc hại mang tính châm biếm, xúc phạm gián tiếp."

The tone is mocking and demeaning, suggesting that the speaker is belittling the target's ability to see or understand things correctly. This can be considered an insult, especially in a context where it is directed at an individual.",

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text 'khu đó sập chx vậy' is a casual, abbreviated way of asking 'khu đó sập chưa vậy?' (Has that area collapsed yet?). It does not contain any insults, profanity, or negative intent toward any individual or group. The tone is neutral and inquiring, without hostility or mockery.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'sập chx' is a phonetic abbreviation of 'sập chùa', which literally means 'a pagoda collapses'. In Vietnamese internet slang, this phrase is often used to mock or exaggerate disaster, failure, or downfall—frequently in a sarcastic or mocking tone. Given that 'chùa' (pagoda) is a religious symbol, using 'sập chùa' to describe a situation (especially a sensitive one) can be seen as disrespectful toward religious or cultural values. The use of coded slang ('chx' for 'chùa') and the tendency to dramatize negativity suggest implicit toxicity, especially if referring to real events or communities."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The comment 'quilen đâm bên nào cũng chí mạng' appears to be a neutral or gameplay-related observation, likely referring to a character's ability in a game. It describes that a character (possibly named or nicknamed 'Quilen') deals critical damage regardless of which side it attacks. There is no indication of insults, profanity, hate speech, mockery, or negative targeting of any individual or group. The tone is descriptive and lacks emotional hostility or cultural sensitivity violations.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'quilen đâm bên nào cũng chí mạng' uses 'quilen' (a slang deformation of 'quý lén' or 'quý LGBT,' often derogatory) to imply that LGBTQ+ individuals are inherently harmful or 'deadly' in any interaction. This perpetuates a negative stereotype and mocks the LGBTQ+ community, making it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'quilen đâm bên nào cũng chí mạng' uses playful, nonsensical wordplay ('quilen' as a deformation of 'quỷ lén' or ghost) and appears metaphorical or humorous rather than targeting anyone. It lacks clear intent to insult, mock, or demean individuals or groups. Without additional context suggesting derogatory use, it reads as imaginative or absurd expression rather than toxic language."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'r đẹp dữ chưa' uses the word 'dữ' (fierce, wild) in a sarcastic or exaggerated manner to mock someone's appearance. The tone implies ridicule rather than genuine compliment, especially when combined with the slang 'r' (short for 'rồi' or 'rứa', common in teen-code). This can be interpreted as an indirect insult or demeaning comment about someone's looks.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'r đẹp dữ chưa' is a colloquial Southern Vietnamese expression meaning 'so beautiful already, right?' or 'damn, you're beautiful.' It uses teen-code ('r' for 'rồi') and informal tone, but carries a complimentary and positive sentiment. There is no insult, mockery, or negative intent. The expression is friendly and typically used in an affectionate or admiring context."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'cố hóp bụng' is a mocking remark about someone's physical appearance, specifically targeting their body shape (implying they are fat and should try to suck in their stomach). This is a form of body-shaming, which is disrespectful and demeaning.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'bả cũng cố hóp bụng luôn á' literally means 'she also tried hard to suck in her stomach'. It may imply a comment on someone's appearance, but without clear mockery, derogatory intent, or use of slang with negative connotations. The tone appears observational rather than hostile or shaming. Without additional context indicating ridicule or body shaming, it leans toward neutral or mildly teasing but not toxic."

Từ 'phốc' có thể ám chỉ hành động thiếu suy nghĩ, nhưng ngữ cảnh không chứa lời lẽ xúc phạm, đe dọa, kỳ thị hay có ý chế nhạo độc hại. Đây là một lời nhận xét về hành vi, không nhắm vào đặc điểm cá nhân hay nhóm xã hội nào.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'đi phốc bừa' is a colloquial and somewhat aggressive way to tell someone to 'charge in recklessly' or 'act without thinking.' While not overtly profane, the tone is dismissive and implies impatience or disdain toward the person ('tranquanganh'). The comment carries a negative, mocking, or belittling intent, making it toxic in context.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'cứ đi phốc bừa đi' uses 'phốc bừa' – a phonetic distortion of 'phán bừa' (to make random, irresponsible statements) – to mock the person's speech or opinions. The tone is dismissive and derisive, implying the person speaks nonsense without basis. Combined with the name, it targets an individual with disrespect, showing contempt rather than constructive criticism."

There is no profanity, insult, sarcasm, targeting of any individual or group, or culturally sensitive derogatory implication. The tone is informational, not hostile or disrespectful.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text 'bệnh đó s trị' is a deformation of 'bệnh đó sai trị' (that disease is treated wrongly), which can be interpreted as mocking or dismissing someone's condition or situation in a derogatory way. The use of 's' instead of 'sai' is a phonetic approximation often used in teen-code or slang to convey sarcasm or ridicule, implying that the subject is beyond help or being mocked for their perceived flaws or issues.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'bệnh đó s trị' is a phonetic abbreviation of 'bệnh đó sao trị', implying that someone's behavior or opinion is fundamentally flawed or irrational, akin to a mental illness. In Vietnamese online discourse, labeling someone as 'bệnh' (sick) is a common derogatory tactic to dismiss, humiliate, or belittle them. This constitutes an indirect but harmful personal attack, falling under verbal abuse and thus toxic."

The emoji ':)))' does not mitigate the toxicity but rather amplifies the sarcastic and mocking intent.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text 'mấy đứa toxic đâu phải con ng:)))' uses informal slang, where 'con ng' is a shortened form of 'con người' (human being). The speaker is likely expressing that toxic people don’t qualify as 'real people', possibly in a humorous or exaggerated way. While it contains mild derogatory undertones toward 'toxic' individuals, it does not target any specific person, group, or identity with hate, profanity, or serious harm. The tone is casual and hyperbolic, supported by the light-hearted ')))' emoticon, indicating jest rather than genuine malice.
