        "toxicity": "TOXIC",
        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Bình luận chứa sự đối lập có tính phân biệt giai cấp và màu da ('nông dân da đen' so với hình mẫu giàu có, địa vị), sử dụng giọng điệu mỉa mai, chế giễu đối tượng 'khanh' và ám chỉ những lựa chọn tiêu cực trong xã hội, gây tổn thương và khơi gợi định kiến.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains derogatory language and stereotypes, particularly targeting people from rural areas or those with darker skin. The phrase 'nông dân da đen' (black-skinned farmer) is used in a derogatory manner, implying a negative stereotype about rural or darker-skinned individuals. The text also suggests a preference for a partner who is 'đẹp, ngoan, gia giáo, giàu, có chức, cha làm lớn' (beautiful, obedient, well-educated, rich, with a high-ranking father), implying a bias against those who do not fit this description. The overall tone is disrespectful and discriminatory.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text uses sarcasm and derogatory language to belittle someone's socioeconomic status and perceived lack of choice. Phrases like 'chui chạng và làm trâu cày' (crawl into holes and be an ox) dehumanize and mock the person, implying they are destined for a life of hardship and servitude. The rhetorical tone mocks their aspirations, particularly in contrasting 'gia giáo, giàu, cha làm lớn' with 'nông dân da đen', reinforcing classist and possibly colorist biases. This creates a humiliating, hostile tone, which fits the definition of implicit toxicity."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains derogatory language and stereotypes targeting specific groups, including religious groups and individuals from certain regions. It uses offensive and disrespectful language, such as 'đm tụi khựa xưa đẻ đực rựa cho nhiều, ra gái thì giết' and 'tụi nó 1 bước lên làm bà nội'. The text also includes insults and negative stereotypes about different genders and sexual orientations, such as 'trai thì chơi bê đê, phải đi kiếm gái nước khác, nữ thì tụi nó 1 bước lên làm bà nội'. The use of profanity and insults directed at specific groups makes the text toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "Text contains multiple derogatory terms and offensive stereotypes: 'tụi khựa' is a racist slur against Chinese people; 'bưng văn hoá nam tử hán' mocks cultural values; 'đẻ đực rựa... giết gái' spreads harmful misinformation about gender discrimination; 'chỉ có cái lồn để offer' is vulgar and sexually objectifying; 'thằng nhóc 13 tóc xoăn chửi chết cụ' uses aggressive, dehumanizing language. The tone is hostile, xenophobic, and misogynistic, with intent to belittle entire groups based on nationality, gender, and sexuality."

It includes hostile sarcasm, generalizations, and emotionally charged ridicule (e.g., mocking someone's lack of experience, threatening tone about family members). While it raises real issues like workplace discrimination, it does so through demeaning, confrontational, and degrading language that creates a hostile tone rather than constructive discussion, thus meeting the criteria for toxicity."
