It contains no insults, slurs, mockery, or negative targeting. The tone is positive and friendly.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text 'đoán vội k20😍' is a playful and casual expression. 'k20' is a phonetic approximation of 'kì 20' (20th time/round), and the emoji 😍 conveys excitement or affection. There is no insult, mockery, or negative intent toward any individual or group. The tone is lighthearted and non-toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'đoán vội k20😍' appears to be a playful or teasing comment, possibly referencing 'K20' (a slang term sometimes used for someone perceived as nerdy or studious, derived from 'khù khờ' or 'khùng 20'). However, without clear derogatory intent, insult, or targeting of personal characteristics like appearance, religion, or identity, and given the affectionate emoji 😍, it leans more toward teasing or banter rather than toxicity. In current Vietnamese online context, such phrases are often used lightly among peers.",

Các từ như “ewww”, “hau háu” mang sắc thái chê trách hành vi, không phải chửi bới hay thù ghét. Nhìn chung là nhận xét xã hội, không chứa tục tĩu/đe doạ/hate speech.",

Ngữ điệu thể hiện sự trung lập, không có ý chế giễu, miệt thị hay tấn công cá nhân/nhóm nào.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text expresses a personal observation about family dynamics and gender equality, using figurative language like '2 cái rựa' (two axes) and '2 con vịt trời' (two wild ducks) as humorous or symbolic representations—possibly alluding to children or siblings—but does not target anyone with insults, mockery, or harmful stereotypes. The speaker explicitly rejects the idea of male privilege ('t con trai được ưu ái hơn') and emphasizes equality. Tone is conversational and reflective, without hostility or toxicity.",
        "toxicity": "NON-TOXIC",
        "toxicity_gpt_reason": "Casual discussion about child gender preference using crude slang (“rựa”, “vịt trời”) but no insults or hostility; it explicitly says boys aren’t favored and both are equal.",
