        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text 'đoán vội k20😍' expresses excitement or admiration towards a group (likely referring to a generation or cohort, e.g., those born around 2000 or first-year university students) with a heart-eyes emoji. It contains no insults, slurs, mockery, or negative targeting. The tone is positive and friendly.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text 'đoán vội k20😍' is a playful and casual expression. 'k20' is a phonetic approximation of 'kì 20' (20th time/round), and the emoji 😍 conveys excitement or affection. There is no insult, mockery, or negative intent toward any individual or group. The tone is lighthearted and non-toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'đoán vội k20😍' appears to be a playful or teasing comment, possibly referencing 'K20' (a slang term sometimes used for someone perceived as nerdy or studious, derived from 'khù khờ' or 'khùng 20'). However, without clear derogatory intent, insult, or targeting of personal characteristics like appearance, religion, or identity, and given the affectionate emoji 😍, it leans more toward teasing or banter rather than toxicity. In current Vietnamese online context, such phrases are often used lightly among peers."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment directly targets an individual with unsolicited advice about their appearance ('giảm cân'), implying they are not attractive as they are. This can be perceived as body-shaming and disrespectful, even if phrased as a suggestion. The tone carries implicit negativity about the person's physical appearance.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The comment directly criticizes someone's appearance by suggesting they should lose weight to be 'more beautiful', which is a personal and sensitive issue. It carries a judgmental tone and implies that the person is currently unattractive, constituting body-shaming — a form of toxicity, especially in Vietnamese social context where such remarks can be deeply stigmatizing."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses the phrase 'nhìn oải ngán mở' to express strong disdain or disgust toward the appearance of a beauty pageant winner ('hoa hậu'). The term 'oải' (exhausted/tired) combined with 'ngán mở' (fed up with looking) conveys harsh criticism, while the emojis 🥴 (rolling eyes/disgust) amplify the mocking and derogatory tone. This constitutes appearance-based insult and negative emotional expression.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'nhìn oải ngán mở..🥴🥴🥴' uses exaggerated expressions of disgust ('oải ngán') and multiple woozy emojis (🥴) to mock the appearance of the 'hoa hậu' (beauty queen). This constitutes a disrespectful and derogatory comment on someone's looks, which falls under appearance-based insult, a form of toxic language."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses 'chipu' (a derogatory slang term for someone who is unattractive or has a poor appearance, often used to mock beauty pageant contestants or women in general). The phrase 'chipu hơn bội phần' intensifies the insult, directly targeting the appearance of a 'hoa hậu' (beauty queen) in a demeaning and disrespectful manner.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase implies that Chi Pu is superior in comparison to the 'hoa hậu' (beauty queen), which is likely a sarcastic or mocking remark questioning the beauty or legitimacy of the beauty queen. The use of 'hơn bội phần' (many times better) in contrast with a public figure like Chi Pu, who has been a controversial figure in beauty and talent debates, adds a layer of insult to the title and person holding it.
