        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The word 'vãi' is a common slang interjection used to express surprise, emphasis, or reaction, similar to 'wow', 'damn', or 'crazy' in English. While it can be a mild profanity in some contexts, as a standalone exclamation with no target, insult, or hostile intent, it is generally considered non-toxic colloquial speech.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The word 'vãi' is a vulgar deformation of 'vãi ra' (literally 'spill out'), often used as an intensifier for frustration, surprise, or anger. While it can be used in casual or humorous contexts among close friends, it is generally considered profane and carries a harsh, emotionally negative tone when directed at someone or something. In many cases, it expresses disrespect or contempt.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "‘Vãi’ là từ lóng phổ biến trong tiếng Việt, thường dùng để nhấn mạnh cảm xúc (ngạc nhiên, ấn tượng, quá mức), không mang ý chỉ trích hay tấn công ai. Dù mang sắc thái suồng sã, nó không độc hại nếu không đi kèm nội dung miệt thị hoặc hướng vào cá nhân/nhóm cụ thể."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Text is an informal phonetic spelling of the common Buddhist invocation 'Nam mô A Di Đà Phật.' There is no evidence of mockery, sarcasm, or negative targeting. The misspelling appears to be casual typing rather than an attempt to demean or show disrespect. The content itself is a religious phrase used neutrally or reverently.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "Câu này là một câu niệm Phật ('Nam mô A Di Đà Phật') phổ biến trong Phật giáo, thể hiện sự tôn kính và không mang tính xúc phạm, công kích hay tiêu cực đối với bất kỳ cá nhân hay nhóm nào. Ngữ cảnh và ý nghĩa đều mang tính tôn giáo, không có yếu tố châm biếm, mỉa mai hay xúc phạm.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'nam mo a di da lat' is a mocking, phonetic distortion of 'nam mô a di đà phật', a sacred Buddhist prayer. Replacing 'phật' (Buddha) with 'lat' (a nonsense or food-related word, possibly referencing 'khoai tây chiên lat' – French fries) shows disrespect toward religious language. This kind of wordplay trivializes and mocks Buddhist beliefs, constituting religious ridicule."

Điều này trái với giá trị giản dị, thoát tục thường thấy trong các tôn giáo tại Việt Nam, mang hàm ý chê bai, công kích sự giả tạo hoặc đạo đức của người tu.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text expresses materialistic aspirations (wealth, luxury items, property) in an exaggerated, humorous, or motivational tone. While the tone is boastful and unrealistic, it does not target any individual or group negatively, nor does it contain insults, slurs, or hostility. The repeated punctuation ('......', '????????') conveys excitement or emphasis rather than toxicity.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text uses sarcasm and exaggeration to mock the idea of religious practice ('tu') by associating it with material wealth and luxury (money, cars, watches, property). This distorts and ridicules spiritual values, implying that being religious is only about showing off wealth, which disrespects believers and promotes a negative stereotype about religious practice in Vietnamese culture."

The use of 'đinh' (nail) is likely a metaphor for irrationality or mental instability, and the laughing emojis (😂😂) emphasize ridicule.

        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'mẹ lão no' is a disrespectful and mocking way of referring to someone's mother, which is highly offensive in Vietnamese culture where familial respect is emphasized.

There is no evidence of toxic elements such as profanity, abuse, or cultural slurs.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses sarcasm and mockery (evident from the laughing emoji 😂) to dismiss or belittle historical or cultural discussions about Emperor Minh Mạng.

'Tích tóp' is a slang expression often used to describe someone nagging or speaking excessively, but in a light-hearted or teasing manner rather than a hostile one. There is no clear target or discriminatory intent, and the tone appears more playful or frustrated rather than abusive. It doesn't promote hate, stereotypes, or emotional harm, and lacks the severity to be classified as toxic."

While negative, it does not target individuals or groups with insults, slurs, or abusive language. It raises a social concern without using derogatory terms, mockery, or hate speech.

The term 'híu ợ' is a phonetic approximation of laughter, further emphasizing the mockery.",

The critique, though harsh, falls within the realm of personal advice or reprimand without using profanity, hate speech, or demeaning stereotypes.

The word 'ác khiết' is particularly strong and conveys hostility.",

While 'ác khiệt' (cruel, harsh) carries strong negative connotation, the phrase appears metaphorical or humorous rather than targeting any individual or group. Without context implying insult or harm toward people, it reads as expressive or exaggerated commentary, possibly about an object’s sharpness or a situation.

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Cụm từ 'kệ mẹ đậu' là biến thể nhẹ, tránh của câu chửi thề. Tuy có chứa yếu tố thô tục ('kệ mẹ') và ám chỉ từ tục tĩu ('đậu' thay cho 'đụ'), nhưng trong ngữ cảnh này, nó không nhắm vào một cá nhân hay nhóm cụ thể nào. Cách nói này thường dùng để bày tỏ sự bực bội, thất vọng chung chung hoặc nhấn mạnh cảm xúc cá nhân, không mang tính xúc phạm, đe dọa, hay phân biệt đối xử.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'kệ mẹ đậu' is a highly disrespectful and vulgar expression in Vietnamese. 'Kệ' means 'to ignore' or 'not care,' but when combined with 'mẹ' (mother) and 'đậu' (a slur or curse word), it becomes a strong insult. This is profane and offensive, targeting the recipient's family in a derogatory manner.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'kệ mẹ đậu' uses 'mẹ' (mother) in a disrespectful, dismissive way, which is a common form of vulgar expression in Vietnamese. 'Kệ mẹ' is a slang construction that shows disregard or defiance in a rude tone. Although 'đậu' (bean) is a euphemism replacing stronger profanity, it still softens but does not eliminate the underlying toxic, impolite tone rooted in cultural norms of disrespecting family relations. This constitutes mild profanity and is considered socially inappropriate."

It does not contain hate speech, mockery, or hostility, and the tone, while potentially boastful, remains self-focused without introducing toxicity into communication.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment expresses an entitled and disrespectful attitude toward household responsibilities and relationships. The phrase 'hạ tiêu chuẩn của mình xuống' (lowering one's standards) implies a condescending view of domestic work or those who do it, which can be seen as demeaning. While not overtly aggressive, the tone conveys arrogance and a lack of consideration for shared responsibilities, introducing negativity into the discussion.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The statement expresses personal sentiment about being pampered by parents and reluctance to lower one’s standards, possibly in a relationship or domestic context. While it may come across as entitled or self-centered, it does not contain insults, profanity, hate speech, or targeting of any individual or group. The tone is assertive but not hostile or abusive, and it lacks malicious intent. Therefore, it falls within the bounds of non-toxic language."

Cách nói này có tính chất miệt thị gián tiếp, gây tổn thương và khuyến khích sự kỳ thị dựa trên sở thích cá nhân.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment discusses a general topic (testosterone levels) with potential causes, including food, drinks, and exposure to Korean idols. While the mention of Korean idols could be seen as a lighthearted stereotype, it does not target any individual or group with hostility, insults, or discrimination. The tone is neutral and informative rather than mocking or demeaning.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The comment implies that exposure to Korean idols—a cultural and entertainment phenomenon—causes a decrease in testosterone, which is a scientifically unfounded and mocking generalization. It carries a ridiculing tone toward fans of Korean pop culture, particularly implying that admiration for idols is emasculating or unnatural, thereby promoting gender stereotypes and cultural bias. This constitutes indirect toxicity through stereotyping and derision."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment contains implicit regional bias and stereotypes. It generalizes and devalues relationships between Vietnamese women and Latin American men ('trai Nam Mỹ + gái Việt thì tao chưa bao giờ gặp'), implying they are undesirable or uncommon due to economic disparities. The phrase 'dây mơ rễ má' (tenuous connections) also subtly dismisses relationships with Russians, reinforcing a negative tone toward certain nationalities or regions.",

It notes a perceived rarity of relationships between Vietnamese women and men from South America, attributing it to economic and social network factors. While phrased casually (e.g., 'tao chưa bao giờ gặp'), the tone is observational rather than derogatory, without using slurs, mockery, or stereotypes to demean any group.
