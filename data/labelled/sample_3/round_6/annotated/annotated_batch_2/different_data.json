        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text 'có hong🤡' uses playful slang for 'có không?' (yes or no) in a casual tone, and the clown emoji adds humor without targeting or demeaning any individual or group. There is no evidence of insults, hate speech, profanity, or negative intent in literal meaning, cultural context, or tone.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The word 'hong' (a slang/teen-code deformation of 'không') is combined with the clown emoji 🤡, which is often used to mock or ridicule someone. The tone implies sarcasm or derision, making it toxic in this context.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'có hong' is a slang/vulgar deformation of 'có không', often used in a mocking or taunting tone. The clown emoji 🤡 intensifies the ridicule, implying the person is foolish or deserving of mockery. This combination is commonly used in a derisive context, especially toward someone perceived as naive or inferior, making it toxic due to its mocking and demeaning intent."

        "toxicity_qwen": "NON-TOXIC",
        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Câu nói 'cạn phước lắm mới gặp page này mãi' là một lời than phiền nhẹ nhàng, mang tính chủ quan về việc không muốn bắt gặp một trang cụ thể. Mặc dù có ý tiêu cực (bực bội, không thích), nó không chứa ngôn ngữ lăng mạ, công kích cá nhân/ nhóm, kỳ thị, đe dọa, hay có ẩn ý chế giễu độc hại. Cách diễn đạt này phổ biến trong văn nói tiếng Việt để bày tỏ sự khó chịu ở mức độ nhẹ, không vượt quá ngưỡng được coi là độc hại.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'cạn phước' (exhausted luck/blessing) is a culturally loaded expression often used sarcastically or negatively to imply that someone is unlucky or undeserving. When combined with 'mới gặp page này mãi' (only now encountering this page after so long), it conveys a dismissive or mocking tone toward the page or its content. The implication is that the speaker views the page as unworthy or that encountering it is a misfortune, which introduces hostility and negativity.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'cạn phước lắm mới gặp page này mãi' uses idiomatic expression 'cạn phước' (run out of luck/merit) in a hyperbolic and humorous way to express frustration or irony about encountering the page after a long time. It does not target any individual or group with disrespect, insult, or discriminatory intent. The tone is colloquial and exasperated but not abusive or hostile, falling within common Vietnamese expressive speech without crossing into toxicity."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'ựa ựa' is a Vietnamese onomatopoeia mimicking the sound of vomiting, often used to express strong disgust or contempt. When directed at a person ('khang nguyễn'), it constitutes a direct, demeaning insult, implying revulsion toward the individual. This is a clear example of toxic language due to its hostile and disrespectful tone.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text consists of a name followed by 'ựa ựa', which is an onomatopoeic expression often used playfully or to mimic sounds (e.g., of animals or fake crying). Without additional context, it does not target anyone negatively, nor does it contain profanity, slurs, or toxic intent. It appears to be a casual or humorous utterance without harm."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment contains a sarcastic and dismissive tone ('chúc mừng em đã tìm thấy hạnh phúc') followed by a cynical remark ('còn thời gian được bao lâu, thì kệ đi em à'). The phrase implies skepticism or mockery toward the person's happiness, suggesting it won't last, which can be emotionally negative and disrespectful.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "Văn bản mang tính chúc mừng và động viên, thể hiện sự quan tâm với cảm xúc của người khác. Câu 'còn thời gian được bao lâu, thì kệ đi em à' thể hiện thái độ buông bỏ nhẹ nhàng, khuyên người khác tận hưởng hạnh phúc hiện tại chứ không mang tính chế giễu, công kích hay phân biệt.

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses a dismissive and condescending tone ('có nhận thức thì biết chứ'), implying the other person is ignorant or lacks understanding. The phrase 'mình k giải thích làm gì :))' further reinforces a mocking or belittling attitude, suggesting the speaker is unwilling to engage in constructive discussion. The emoji ':))' adds sarcasm, making the overall tone disrespectful and toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The statement expresses a dismissive attitude but does not contain insults, profanity, or targeted negativity. The tone is casual and somewhat aloof, implying that the listener should already understand without needing explanation. While slightly passive-aggressive, it lacks harmful intent, mockery, or derogatory language, and thus does not meet the threshold for toxicity."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text uses vague language ('ng ta' for 'người ta') and does not clearly target any specific individual or group with harmful intent. The phrase 'sợ tuyệt chủng' (afraid of extinction) could be interpreted in various contexts, but without additional context indicating discrimination, insults, or hate speech, it remains ambiguous. The laughing emojis suggest a humorous or dismissive tone, but not necessarily toxic mockery. Overall, the comment lacks explicit or implicit toxicity as defined.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses a dismissive and mocking tone ('thôi ng ta sợ tuyệt chủng á nên kệ đi') combined with laughing emojis (😂😂). While not explicitly insulting, the phrasing implies ridicule toward a group or individual's concerns (e.g., fear of 'extinction'), which can be interpreted as belittling or demeaning. The sarcastic undertone and lack of constructive engagement make it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text uses humor (indicated by laughing emojis) to comment on someone being afraid of extinction, likely in a playful or exaggerated context. There is no direct insult, slur, or derogatory reference to any individual or group. While 'tuyệt chủng' (extinction) might imply criticism, it lacks a specific target or malicious intent, and the tone appears light-hearted rather than hostile or demeaning."

The phrase 'nói chuyện khó nghe' (hard-to-hear words) combined with 'chưa chắc còn cái mình đã hp bằng người ta' (not sure if what you have is as happy as others) and 'mình kg chúc phúc cho người ta thì thôi' (if you don’t bless others, then stop) implies criticism and a dismissive tone. While not overtly aggressive, the wording conveys passive-aggressive judgment and emotional negativity, making it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text expresses a personal reflection on humility and refraining from wishing harm or making negative comments toward others, even when one feels disadvantaged. While the phrasing is somewhat informal and emotional, it promotes restraint and self-awareness rather than hostility or insult. There is no direct or indirect targeting, mockery, or use of slang/teen-code with negative connotations. The overall tone leans toward introspection and moral positioning, not toxicity."

There is no indication of mockery, hate speech, sarcasm, or targeting of individuals or groups, and the tone is neutral.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text deforms the names of Vietnamese public figures ('Trung Tín', 'Tấn Phước', 'Đăng Khương') in a mocking or disrespectful manner, which can be seen as a form of ridicule or personal attack. The tone implies negativity and lacks respect, fitting the definition of toxic language.",

'Come out' ở đây có thể hiểu theo nghĩa đơn giản là 'xuất hiện' hoặc trêu về việc chưa hoàn thành bài tập, không có bằng chứng cho thấy ám chỉ hoặc chế giễu cộng đồng LGBTQ+. Giọng điệu mang tính thông báo/trêu chơi thân mật, không mang tính độc hại.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text uses 'chi nguyen' (a mocking deformation of a name, possibly implying 'chị Nguyễn' or a specific person) and 'come out' in a derogatory way, likely referencing LGBTQ+ terminology ('come out' as in revealing one's sexual orientation). The tone suggests ridicule or mockery toward the individual, making it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'chưa đạt thể dục xog come out' mocks Chi Nguyen in a derogatory way by implying their coming out as LGBTQ+ is trivial or laughable, comparable to failing a physical education test. The use of 'come out' in a sarcastic, flippant context combined with the dismissive tone constitutes mockery of LGBTQ+ identity, which is a form of implicit toxicity."

Ngữ cảnh cho thấy đây là lời lẽ thô tục, có tính chất khiếm nhã và thiếu tôn trọng, tạo ra sự khó chịu và tiêu cực trong giao tiếp.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'ko có chim' is a vulgar and derogatory slang term in Vietnamese, often used to insult someone by implying they are emasculated or worthless. The use of such explicit profanity, even without a direct target, creates a hostile and offensive tone.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'xl' is a common abbreviation for 'xin lỗi' (sorry). The term 'chim' can be slang for penis, so the sentence 'a ko có chim' could be interpreted as a self-deprecating or joking remark about lacking something, possibly in a humorous or ironic context. However, without clear targeting, hostility, or intent to demean others, and given the ambiguous and potentially playful tone, it does not meet the criteria for toxicity. The statement appears to be a personal, possibly sarcastic comment without abusive or discriminatory intent."

The use of 'thèn' (slang for 'người') and the weeping emojis (😩) convey strong emotion, but not in a way that attacks identity, promotes discrimination, or uses abusive language.

While the tone is slightly sarcastic or melancholic, it does not contain insults, slurs, or harmful intent toward any individual or group. The references are cultural and humorous rather than derogatory.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'đàm vĩnh hưng ơi, quốc tịch mỹ ơi' uses sarcasm to imply betrayal or disloyalty, referencing the singer Đàm Vĩnh Hưng's U.S. citizenship in a mocking tone. 'Lẩu gà Bình Thuận đồ' is a phonetic play that sounds like 'lộ hàng, bị đu', suggesting exposure of something hidden (like disloyalty). Combined, this mocks the person for being unpatriotic or pretending to be Vietnamese while allegedly favoring America.

The term 'vãi' is a vulgar intensifier. Together, the sentence expresses strong disapproval and mockery toward those comments, implying they are excessively or offensively regional-bashing.

Trong bối cảnh teen-code hoặc mạng xã hội, cụm này thường được dùng để chế giễu, gợi liên tưởng đến các stereotype tiêu cực về phụ nữ từ Thanh Hóa.

        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The statement mocks the '5 teachings of Uncle Ho' (a revered moral guideline for Vietnamese youth), using sarcasm ('=))') to imply disregard or disrespect toward a culturally and politically significant value. This trivialization of a national symbol can be seen as disrespectful and socially insensitive in Vietnamese context."

The statement 'tui ko ăn nha' (I don't eat it) implicitly disdains or distances the speaker from this symbol, perpetuating a negative stereotype about people from that region. This constitutes disrespect and regional discrimination, aligning with the definition of toxic language.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses the phrase 'cá rô cây' in a lighthearted and regional context, referencing a cultural stereotype about Central Vietnam's poverty (as in Example 6). However, the tone here is playful and self-deprecating ('miền tây tui ko ăn nha'), without targeting or insulting any individual or group. There is no explicit or implicit hostility, mockery, or harmful intent toward others.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "Người nói phủ nhận việc mình (từ miền Tây) ăn 'cá rô cây', một hình ảnh liên quan đến sự nghèo khó, nhưng ở đây mang tính phân biệt vùng miền tích cực (khẳng định bản thân không thuộc hình ảnh tiêu cực đó) chứ không chế giễu người khác. Không có dấu hiệu nhắm vào nhóm cụ thể để xúc phạm hay hạ thấp, tone mang tính cá nhân, bảo vệ bản sắc hơn là công kích."

The tone is proactive and oppositional to toxicity, with a thumbs-up emoji indicating positive intent. It promotes a constructive stance against discrimination without using hate speech, insults, or derogatory language toward protected groups.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text uses 'pbvm' (a derogatory abbreviation for 'phở bò Việt Nam,' often used to mock Northern Vietnamese) in a confrontational context ('combat ngoài đời'). The phrase 'bất kể già hay trẻ' (regardless of age) implies a hostile, generalized attack on a regional group, signaling toxicity through regional slurs and aggressive intent.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The term 'pbvm' is a derogatory acronym for 'phản bội Việt Minh' (traitor to the Vietnamese revolution), often used as a slur against political opponents or those perceived as disloyal. The phrase '+1 sẵn sàng combat ngoài đời' (ready to fight in real life) combined with 'bọn pbvm bất kể già hay trẻ' (regardless of old or young) expresses willingness to use violence against a group of people, which constitutes a threat and promotes hostility.

The phrase suggests that the speaker is unleashing a torrent of insults as if they have been repressed, and the praying hands emoji (🙏) is used sarcastically to mock or emphasize the intensity of the insults. This constitutes toxic language due to its verbal aggression and disrespectful intent.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'chửi như chưa bao giờ được chửi' is a hyperbolic, sarcastic expression often used humorously or ironically to describe someone venting or speaking aggressively, but not necessarily with real malice.

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment generalizes negatively about 'người thông minh' (intelligent people) as being 'ích kỷ và khôn lỏi' (selfish and cunning), which is a sweeping stereotype that can be seen as demeaning. While it acknowledges exceptions ('không phải ai cũng như vậy'), the overall tone still carries a critical and somewhat disrespectful implication toward a broad group. The phrase 'xl những ng tốt quê Hưng 36' (apologizing to good people from Hưng Yên) also subtly reinforces the negative generalization by implying that others from the same group may not be 'tốt'.",

The comment is a general, meta observation about a style of communication and does not target any individual or group with insults, hate speech, profanity, or demeaning language.
