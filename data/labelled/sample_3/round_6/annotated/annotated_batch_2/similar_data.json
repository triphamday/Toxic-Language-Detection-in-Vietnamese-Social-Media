        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The phrase 'hạnh phúc 1 tang gia' sarcastically links happiness to a funeral, mocking or trivializing a solemn cultural event, which is disrespectful and introduces negativity.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'hạnh phúc 1 tang gia' is a sarcastic twist on the title of a famous Vietnamese literary work ('Số Đỏ' by Vũ Trọng Phụng), where 'hạnh phúc của một tang gia' (the happiness of a mourning family) satirizes hypocrisy and moral decay. Here, the comment implies mockery or disdain toward a situation where a family's misfortune (a funeral) is treated as a cause for happiness or celebration. The tone is cynical and disrespectful, targeting the family or the context negatively.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'hạnh phúc 1 tang gia' (happy at a funeral) is a clear contradiction, using sarcasm to mock or belittle someone's emotional state or behavior in a context where grief is expected. In Vietnamese culture, funerals are serious and respectful occasions; associating happiness with a funeral desecrates this norm and implies insensitivity or mockery toward the deceased or mourners. The statement carries implicit disrespect and emotional dissonance, making it toxic."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'bị lũ đấm' is a slang deformation of 'bị lừa đấm' (being fooled/punched), implying the target is stupid or easily deceived. The emojis 😎👉 add a mocking, provocative tone, suggesting the speaker is taunting or belittling someone. The intent is to insult or provoke, making it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'bị lũ đấm' uses dehumanizing language by referring to a group as 'lũ' (a derogatory collective pronoun implying a mob or rabble), and 'đấm' (punch) likely refers to people associated with punching or violence, possibly alluding to activists or opponents in a mocking way. The tone is confrontational and dismissive, with the addition of 'có tri ko' (do you have consciousness?) implying others are mindless. The emoji 😎👉 adds a taunting,挑衅 (provocative) tone, showing superiority and mockery."

        "toxicity": "TOXIC",
        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Bình luận sử dụng ngôn ngữ buộc tội ('nghiệp báo'), phủ nhận cảm xúc của người khác ('đừng đóng vai nạn nhân'), và có lời lẽ miệt thị giới tính ('mấy con như bn', 'không phải phụ nữ nào cũng đáng được trân trọng'). Tông giọng mỉa mai, đổ lỗi và lan tỏa định kiến tiêu cực.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains several elements of toxicity. The phrase 'ông trời bất công' (God is unfair) and 'nghiệp báo đến kiếp này' (karma from past lives) implies a judgmental and dismissive attitude towards someone's suffering. The phrase 'đừng đóng vai nạn nhân' (don't act like a victim) is accusatory and dismissive of someone's experiences. The use of 'nhờ mấy con như bn mình' (thanks to people like you) and 'mọi người cũng thế' (everyone is the same) suggests a generalizing and demeaning tone towards a group of people. The overall tone is accusatory, dismissive, and lacks empathy, making it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text uses deeply negative and demeaning language, such as accusing someone of carrying 'nghiệp báo từ kiếp trước' (karmic retribution from past life), which implies inherent moral inferiority. It directly attacks the individual by telling them not to 'đóng vai nạn nhân' (play the victim) and uses the vulgar term 'khắm' (offensive slang implying something foul or despicable). Furthermore, it generalizes and devalues both women and men by suggesting that people like the target prove not all deserve respect, promoting disdain and misanthropy. This constitutes personal attack and emotional hostility."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text uses derogatory and discriminatory language towards LGBT individuals, explicitly labeling their identity as resulting from 'degenerate and deviant thoughts' ('biến chất lệch lạch'). It objectifies relationships with slang like 'trai cũng ăn được gái cũng ăn được' and implies that being LGBT is unnatural, leading to social issues such as population aging. This perpetuates negative stereotypes and introduces hostility based on sexual orientation, fitting the definition of toxic speech.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains derogatory language and harmful implications about the LGBTQ community. It uses phrases like 'suy nghĩ biến chất lệch lạch' (deviant and twisted thinking) and 'sinh ra không đầy đủ' (born incomplete) to describe LGBTQ individuals, which are deeply offensive and demeaning. The text also implies that LGBTQ individuals are not 'normal' and that their existence is a result of abnormal thinking and behavior. Additionally, the text suggests that LGBTQ individuals are promiscuous and that their relationships are not as meaningful as heterosexual ones, which perpetuates harmful stereotypes and discrimination.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text contains derogatory and stigmatizing statements about LGBTQ people, describing their identities as 'biến chất lệch lạch' (deviant and corrupted thinking), implying they are psychologically distorted due to living with 'người đẹp' (beautiful people). It also promotes harmful stereotypes by suggesting being LGBTQ is a result of indulgent lifestyles and weakening family values, and references a discredited 'rat utopia' experiment to justify prejudice. These elements constitute discriminatory and demeaning language, making the content toxic."
