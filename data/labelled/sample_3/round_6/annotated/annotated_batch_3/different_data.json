The phrase 'lè nhè' describes annoyance, and 'vác lên đóng đinh' is ambiguous but likely metaphorical, lacking explicit toxicity in context.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text uses the phrase 'lè nhà lè nhè' (a mocking or exaggerated way to describe someone's behavior, often implying laziness or clumsiness) combined with the clown emoji (🤡), which signals ridicule. The tone is derogatory and implies mockery toward the target, making it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'lè nhà lè nhè' is a mocking deformation of someone's speech, implying foolishness or lack of intelligence. 'Vác lên đóng đinh nữa giờ' suggests futile or absurd effort, amplifying the ridicule. The clown emoji 🤡 intensifies the mockery, indicating the speaker is belittling someone’s actions or intellect in a derogatory, disrespectful manner."

It lacks profanity, hostile intent, or implicit mockery, and does not promote discrimination or negativity.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'tế trời chứ tế cho ngọc hoàng à' uses sarcasm to mock traditional religious practices, specifically the worship of Ngọc Hoàng (Jade Emperor) in Taoism or folk beliefs. The tone implies disrespect toward a religious figure and the associated belief system, which can be seen as demeaning to those who hold these beliefs. The use of sarcasm here introduces hostility and negativity into the discussion about religion.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'tế trời chứ tế cho ngọc hoàng à mà tế' uses religious-cultural references mockingly. 'Tế' (ritual sacrifice) is a sacred practice in Vietnamese ancestral and spiritual beliefs. By sarcastically questioning whether one should worship Ngọc Hoàng (a revered figure in folk religion) instead of 'trời' (Heaven), the statement trivializes traditional beliefs. The rhetorical and ironic tone ('mà tế') implies disrespect toward cultural rituals, which constitutes implicit toxicity by demeaning shared spiritual values."

It uses common abbreviations like 'trl' for 'trả lời' and has a neutral, urging tone without targeting any individual or group. There is no profanity, insult, hate speech, or implicit toxicity present. The intent is to prompt a response, not to demean or harass.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'trl đi thắc mắc thật' uses 'trl' (a phonetic approximation of 'trẻ ranh' or 'trẻ trâu', meaning 'brat' or 'immature kid') in a dismissive and condescending tone. The addition of 'thắc mắc thật' ('really questioning') implies mockery or irritation toward the target, suggesting their concerns or questions are trivial or annoying. This conveys disrespect and hostility.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'trl đi thắc mắc thật' is a casual, slightly impatient way of saying 'reply already, you're really curious,' but it lacks hostile intent, insults, or profanity. It may express mild annoyance, but does not target anyone disrespectfully or with abusive language. The tone is colloquial and common in informal online interactions without crossing into toxicity."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'vậy là cha theo tư bản?' uses the word 'cha' (father) in a sarcastic or mocking tone to imply ideological opposition or disdain toward someone's beliefs or affiliations.

Trong bối cảnh xã hội Việt Nam, việc đề cập đến 'tư bản' có thể gợi liên hệ chính trị, nhưng ở đây không có dấu hiệu chế giễu, phân biệt hoặc tấn công nhóm người hay cá nhân. Do đó, câu này được xem là không độc hại trong phạm vi ngôn ngữ và ngữ cảnh biểu đạt."

The use of a smiley emoticon (':)') suggests sarcasm or dismissiveness, implicitly mocking or belittling this cultural symbol. This introduces negativity and disrespect towards a shared heritage, aligning with toxic behavior by undermining cultural values in a passive-aggressive manner.",

Việc đặt câu hỏi kiểu 'vậy sao phải nói... làm gì?' kèm theo dấu cười ':)' thể hiện sự coi thường, giễu cợt giá trị văn hóa – lịch sử chung, có thể gây chia rẽ và xúc phạm cảm xúc tập thể.

While some points may reflect personal opinions, the overall tone is condescending, stereotyping, and emotionally charged, particularly toward gender roles. The phrasing implies that women who hold these expectations are unreasonable, and the language ('mất lượt', 'hòng lấy vk') carries implicit hostility. This perpetuates negativity and tension in discussions about relationships.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text expresses personal opinions and critiques of gender role expectations in relationships, using informal language and rhetorical questions. While some phrases like 'ủa nứng hay j?' are colloquial and slightly provocative, they serve to question unrealistic expectations rather than attack or insult any individual or group. The tone is critical but not abusive, and the speaker emphasizes personal choice and mutual respect. There is no use of slurs, mockery based on identity, or targeted hostility. The discussion remains within the bounds of social commentary rather than toxic shaming or discrimination."

Lời nói không nhắm mục tiêu công kích, xúc phạm cá nhân hay nhóm người cụ thể nào, mà chỉ là phàn nàn về một trò chơi. Đây là cách diễn đạt thô tục phổ biến trong cộng đồng game thủ Việt khi thể hiện cảm xúc tiêu cực về gameplay, không mang tính chất kỳ thị, đe dọa hay quấy rối.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains strong profanity ('đéo', 'lồn') used in a harsh and negative context to criticize the game. While the profanity is not directly targeting a person or group, the tone is aggressive and emotionally charged, expressing frustration in a disrespectful and vulgar manner. This falls under toxic language due to the use of explicit swear words and a hostile tone.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The word 'đéo' and 'lồn' are strong profanities in Vietnamese, used here to express frustration in a vulgar manner. The phrase 'game như lồn' is a crude insult toward the game, showing disrespect and aggressive tone. Although 'reroll đc mà' is a suggestion, the overall expression is loaded with offensive language, making it toxic."

Even with laughing emojis, the expression conveys a dismissive or insulting tone, fitting the definition of toxic language as emotionally negative or disrespectful.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'chim cút thôi' is a casual, playful way to say 'just shut up' or 'stop talking' in Vietnamese slang, often used among friends or in lighthearted contexts. The emoji ':))' softens the tone, indicating it is not meant to be harsh or insulting. There is no targeting of an individual or group, nor does it contain profanity, slurs, or harmful intent.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'chim cút thôi' literally means 'just a quail', which is a small bird, often used colloquially to downplay something as insignificant or minor. The tone, marked by ':))', is lighthearted and non-confrontational. There is no identifiable target, insult, or derogatory implication in this context. It does not carry regional, religious, or personal slurs, nor does it use toxic slang or harmful innuendo. Thus, it is non-toxic."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Bình luận sử dụng ngôn ngữ thô tục ('đéo', 'tụi mày') và thảo luận chủ đề nhạy cảm (quan hệ sugar baby), nhưng mang tính chất phân tích xã hội và trình bày quan điểm cá nhân về động cơ trong các mối quan hệ. Mặc dù có giọng điệu mỉa mai và phê phán, nó không nhắm vào cá nhân hay nhóm cụ thể nào với mục đích xúc phạm, đe dọa, hoặc kỳ thị dựa trên đặc điểm bẩm sinh. Nội dung chủ yếu là chỉ trích hiện tượng xã hội và bày tỏ quan điểm triết lý về tình yêu/hôn nhân, không chứa ngôn từ thù địch, phân biệt đối xử, hoặc tấn công cá nhân rõ ràng.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains derogatory language and stereotypes about women, particularly those involved in relationships with 'daddy' figures. It implies that women are only interested in financial support and sex, and that they are manipulative and unfaithful. The text also dismisses the idea of long-term, committed relationships and marriage, portraying them as unrealistic and unhappy. The overall tone is negative, disrespectful, and judgmental toward women, making it toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text uses degrading language and stereotypes about women ('gái làm sgbb', 'chia ca cho 2,3 anh', 'test thử rồi cút') to portray relationships as transactional and purely sexual, reducing women to objects for male consumption. It promotes cynical, misogynistic views by dismissively rejecting emotional connection, marriage, and love as naive or 'tham lam', while normalizing exploitation and gender-based double standards. The overall tone is contemptuous and propagates harmful societal attitudes toward women and relationships."

While it generalizes about a group, it explicitly states 'not all,' uses no profanity or slurs, and focuses on practical advice rather than hostility, insults, or demeaning language. The tone is opinionated but remains within respectful discourse.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains derogatory language and stereotypes about women, referring to them as 'mấy bà' (a term that can be seen as disrespectful) and suggesting that they are the cause of unnecessary conflicts. The phrase 'ko phải tất cả nha, né mấy bà giống thế này ra là được' implies that women are generally problematic and should be avoided. The overall tone is dismissive and disrespectful toward women, promoting a negative stereotype and generalizing about an entire group.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text generalizes and stereotypes women as being narcissistic and manipulative due to media influence, promoting negative gender bias. It encourages avoidance and disdain toward women with a dismissive tone ('né mấy bà', 'chả được cái gì, chỉ mất thời gian'), dehumanizing them and reinforcing misogynistic attitudes. Phrases like 'các chị nghĩ mình là nhất, là số một nên các anh phải chạy theo' reflect hostility and resentment, creating a discriminatory and hostile environment toward women."

It does not contain explicit insults, threats, or derogatory language directed at any individual or group.

While it uses strong language and hypothetical scenarios (e.g., 'm đi từ chùa chiền... cũng đc', 'cứt cmmđ'), these are not directed at a specific individual or group with intent to demean. The tone includes humor (e.g., 'sống nổi ko', ':))') and reflects a critique of generalizations rather than promoting discrimination. Though potentially provocative, it stays within the bounds of debate on gender dynamics without crossing into hate speech, slurs, or targeted abuse."

The tone is argumentative but not toxic, focusing on cultural differences rather than personal attacks."
