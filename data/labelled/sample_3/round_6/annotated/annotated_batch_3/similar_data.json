Cụm từ này gây chia rẽ, khái quát hóa và xúc phạm đến một nhóm người dựa trên niềm tin tôn giáo của họ.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'công giáo đi trước giặc bước theo sau' is a historically charged and derogatory saying in Vietnamese culture, often used to imply that Catholicism (or Christians) collude with foreign invaders (e.g., French colonialists). It carries a strong negative connotation, associating a religious group with betrayal or collaboration, which is toxic as it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and hostility toward Catholics.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'công giáo đi trước, giặc bước theo sau' is a derogatory stereotype implying that Catholics (công giáo) are collaborators with enemies ('giặc'), historically referencing colonial or foreign forces.

Bình luận ám chỉ sự thiếu tôn trọng hoặc không tuân thủ việc treo quốc kỳ, một biểu tượng thiêng liêng, từ đó tạo ra sự chỉ trích gián tiếp và mỉa mai, gây chia rẽ về mặt cảm xúc và có thể khơi gợi tranh cãi tiêu cực.",

This constitutes discriminatory and intolerant speech targeting religious groups, fitting the definition of toxicity through implicit hostility and cultural bias.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text contains strong nationalistic and religious undertones that dismiss the relevance of foreign deities and religions, implying a rejection of external religious influences. The phrases 'không thờ chúa lạ' (do not worship foreign gods) and 'chẳng nhờ chúa ai' (do not rely on any foreign god) are derogatory towards other religions and imply that Vietnamese culture and beliefs are superior. The overall tone is exclusionary and dismissive of other religious beliefs, which is toxic.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text uses strong religiously charged and nationalist language to reject and demean Christianity, referring to it as 'giáo giặc' (invader's religion) and 'chúa ai' (foreign lord), which are derogatory terms. Phrases like 'không cần giáo giặc' (don't need the invaders' religion) and 'giặc sang' (invaders coming) associate Christianity with colonialism and betrayal of Vietnamese identity, framing it as un-Vietnamese and harmful. This constitutes religious incitement and promotes hostility toward a religious group, which qualifies as toxic under cultural and social context, even if framed as patriotic sentiment."

        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text uses 'con chiên' and repeats 'chiên con' — a term that, when repeated playfully, becomes a mocking deformation of 'con chiên' (flock/follower, often associated with Christians). The imagery of dropping from 'human' to 'beast' then being fried ('bỏ vô chảo nó chiên') combines religious mockery with dehumanization. The phrase 'buồn buồn nó bỏ vô chảo' adds casual, sarcastic cruelty. Together with the cooking metaphor, it ridicules religious followers as helpless, absurd, or inferior, constituting indirect religious mockery and dehumanization."
