        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The text is a neutral or figurative statement about tigers ('hổ') eating meat for a year, with no direct or implied insults, slurs, mockery, or negative targeting of any individual or group. It does not exhibit toxicity in literal meaning, cultural context, intent, or tone.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'hổ ăn 1 năm không hết thịt' is a Vietnamese idiom used to mock someone for being overweight or excessively large, implying they are so fat that even a tiger couldn't finish eating their meat in a year. This is a direct appearance-based insult, targeting an individual's physical attributes in a derogatory manner.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'hổ ăn 1 năm không hết thịt' literally means 'a tiger couldn't eat all the meat in a year,' which appears to be a metaphorical or exaggerated expression. Without context, it lacks a clear target or negative intent. It does not contain identifiable slurs, mockery, or toxic implications toward any individual or group. The statement is ambiguous and could be interpreted as hyperbolic praise or admiration rather than criticism or insult. Therefore, it is classified as non-toxic due to absence of clear harmful intent or cultural derogation."

        "toxicity_qwen": "NON-TOXIC",
        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The word 'đẹp' (beautiful) is used with laughing emojis (😂😂), which in Vietnamese online context typically indicates sarcasm or mockery, suggesting insincerity and ridiculing the subject's appearance or quality. This aligns with toxic behavior where superficially positive remarks convey contempt or negativity through implicit signals like emojis.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment consists of a simple compliment ('đẹp' meaning 'beautiful') accompanied by laughing emojis. There is no insult, mockery, or negative intent toward any individual or group. The tone is lighthearted and positive.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text 'đẹp 😂😂' literally means 'beautiful' or 'nice', and is likely used sarcastically or humorously given the laughing emojis. However, without context or a clear target, there is no identifiable insult, mockery of a group, or toxic intent. The phrase alone does not convey hostility, discrimination, or abuse. It remains at the level of ambiguous, casual expression, which is insufficient to classify as toxic."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The comment uses playful phonetic spelling ('đỉm' for 'điểm', 'nàkk' for 'nào') to express a neutral or positive remark about awarding points, with no insults, targeting, or harmful intent detected in literal meaning or cultural context.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text uses '10 đỉm' (a phonetic approximation of '10 điểm' meaning '10 points'), but 'đỉm' is a deformation of 'điếm' (prostitute), turning the phrase into a derogatory insult. 'Ban nàkk' is also a mocking deformation of 'bạn nà' (this person), implying disrespect. The combination conveys a harsh, demeaning tone.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text '10 đỉm cho ban nàkk' appears to be a phonetic or stylized way of writing '10 điểm cho bạn nha', which is a friendly, playful expression often used to praise or compliment someone (similar to 'full marks for you'). The misspelling ('đỉm', 'nàkk') is likely for stylistic or affectionate emphasis, common in casual online Vietnamese speech. There is no insult, mockery, or negative intent detected. The tone is positive and lighthearted."

It lacks explicit or implicit signals of hostility, contempt, or targeted negativity, and no cultural or contextual indicators suggest toxicity.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'không ngại à' in this context can carry a sarcastic or mocking tone, implying that the person being addressed is shameless or audacious in a negative way. It can be interpreted as a subtle insult or a way to express disapproval or contempt, especially if used in a confrontational or dismissive manner.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'không ngại à' (aren't you afraid?) is a neutral question that can vary in tone depending on context, but as a standalone comment, it lacks hostile intent, profanity, or targeted negativity. Without additional context indicating mockery, threat, or sarcasm, it is best interpreted as a simple, albeit slightly informal, inquiry."

The tone is mildly critical and informal, but lacks elements of toxicity such as abuse, threats, or mockery based on identity.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'bí phèo' is a phonetic deformation of 'Bình Phước,' a province in Vietnam, often used in a derogatory or mocking manner to stereotype people from that region. The term carries a negative connotation, implying backwardness or lack of sophistication, and is used to demean individuals or groups based on their regional origin.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "- 'bí phèo' là cách nói lái của 'bị phát, bị phe phẩy', mang ý mỉa mai, chế giễu, thường dùng để miêu tả người có tư tưởng cực đoan, bị coi là 'lệch lạc' hoặc 'ngu ngốc'.\n- Cụm 'định nghĩa này là bí phèo' mang tính xúc phạm, phủ nhận giá trị của định nghĩa một cách mỉa mai, thiếu tôn trọng.\n- Ngữ cảnh sử dụng teen-code/slang nhằm tăng tính châm biếm, thể hiện thái độ coi thường, không phải tranh luận xây dựng.\n→ Do đó, đây là ngôn ngữ độc hại dưới hình thức chế giễu, mỉa mai."

There is no insult, mockery, or negative targeting of any individual or group. The emoji ':))' further reinforces the playful and non-toxic intent.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'giá như nhà nuôi lợn mà được tốt ntn' uses irony and the comparison to a pig ('lợn') to insult someone’s appearance or behavior, implying they resemble a pig in a derogatory way. The laughing tone ':))' reinforces mockery. In Vietnamese context, calling someone 'lợn' is a common appearance- or behavior-based insult, making this indirectly toxic."

This constitutes name-calling targeting an individual, which is toxic behavior. The smiling emoji may indicate sarcasm or mockery, reinforcing the negative intent.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The term 'chuppy' is a derogatory slang deformation of 'chó Pug' (Pug dog), often used to mock someone's appearance, implying they look like a dog or are unattractive. The playful emoji 🙂 does not mitigate the insulting intent, as it is used sarcastically to soften the mockery rather than express genuine friendliness. The comment targets an individual with a personal attack on their looks.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text appears to mention two names, 'kimngan' and 'Chuppy', with a smiley emoji 🙂, which generally conveys a neutral or friendly tone. There is no evident insult, mockery, or use of slang/teen-code with negative connotations. Without further context implying derogatory meaning or targeting someone negatively, the comment is considered non-toxic."

        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "Although the comment appears neutral on the surface, '🐷' (pig) is often used in Vietnamese online contexts as a derogatory nickname for someone perceived as greedy, lazy, or unclean. Requesting 'cách nuôi' (how to raise) implies treating a person like an animal, which is dehumanizing. Combined with the cultural context, this can be an indirect insult, especially if directed at a specific individual or group."

Mặc dù không có từ ngữ tục tĩu trực tiếp, nhưng nó mang hàm ý tiêu cực và có thể gây tổn thương khi nhắm vào một cá nhân.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'nhìn ko ra con gì luôn' is a derogatory expression implying that someone or something is unrecognizable or looks like an indistinct, possibly repulsive creature. It carries a strong negative connotation, often used to insult someone's appearance or demean them in a disrespectful manner.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'nhìn ko ra con gì luôn' literally means 'can't recognize what animal it is at all' and is often used colloquially when someone cannot identify an object, creature, or image. It lacks a clear target, contains no profanity, slur, or derogatory implication, and does not convey hostility or negative intent toward any individual or group.

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The term 'chuphi' is a derogatory deformation of 'chú Phi' or 'chú Phi-líp-pin,' often used to mock or belittle individuals of Filipino descent or Southeast Asian appearance.

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses '6' (a phonetic approximation of 'xấu' meaning 'ugly') in a mild, observational tone to describe someone's appearance ('tuy 6 nhg') but balances it with praise for their stage presence ('thể hiện thần thái trên sân khấu cg rất xs') and facial attractiveness ('khuôn mặt xinh ưa nhìn'). There is no explicit insult, mockery, or harmful intent toward any individual or group. The tone is neutral and focuses on constructive critique rather than verbal aggression.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The comment contains a mix of constructive observation and mild criticism about stage presence and facial expression, but does not use profanity, insults, or derogatory slang. The phrase 'tuy 6 nhg' uses '6' (slang for 'sáu', meaning 'okay' or 'fine' in teen code), and 'xs' likely means 'xuất sắc' (excellent). While there is critique, it remains within acceptable, non-aggressive language and does not target identity, appearance in a demeaning way, or use toxic stereotypes."

While it may carry a mildly critical tone, it does not contain explicit insults, slurs, or derogatory intent. The statement is neutral in terms of toxicity, as it lacks hostility, mockery, or harmful implications toward any individual or group.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'đây là hoa hạu ư' appears to be a misspelling or phonetic approximation of 'đây là hoa hậu ư' (Is this a beauty queen?), possibly implying surprise or mild sarcasm. However, without additional context or target, the tone remains ambiguous and does not clearly convey mockery, insult, or derogatory intent. It lacks explicit toxicity, slurs, or hostile language, and the use of 'hậụ' instead of 'hậu' seems like a typo rather than a coded insult. Therefore, it is classified as NON-TOXIC."

The phrase 'quế anh' (a play on 'Quảng Nam') is used to contrast with 'Hà Nội' (HN), implying a derogatory comparison between regions. The wording 'đọc thì hiểu coi ngta nói gì chứ đọc để nhai hay sao' also carries a sarcastic, condescending tone, indirectly belittling others' opinions. This reflects regional bias and verbal aggression.",

        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'người đẹp j như thế' appears to be a sarcastic or ironic comment, possibly mocking someone's appearance by exaggerating beauty. However, without clear context or a specific target, and given that it uses indirect and ambiguous language, it does not clearly meet the threshold for toxicity. It lacks explicit insults, slurs, or profanity, and the tone, while potentially dismissive, is not strongly abusive or discriminatory.

There is no intent to insult, demean, or target anyone negatively. The tone is humorous and non-aggressive.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'chà bông bao nhiêu cân vậy' is a playful or teasing comment, often used humorously to imply someone is chubby or plump, comparing them to 'chà bông' (pork floss), which is fluffy and light. However, without a clear negative intent or targeting in a hostile way, and given the use of laughing emojis (😅), it leans more toward banter than genuine insult. In Vietnamese online culture, such remarks can be part of light-hearted teasing among familiar peers and do not necessarily constitute toxicity unless used aggressively or repetitively in a demeaning context."

The intent is to inform and caution others about transmission risks, which is neutral and non-hostile.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment implies that people who work in nail salons (often associated with a specific demographic, such as Vietnamese women in certain contexts) are a source of disease transmission ('rất dễ để lây'). This perpetuates a harmful stereotype and could be seen as stigmatizing or discriminatory toward a particular group, even if unintentionally. The tone is dismissive and carries negative implications about an occupation and the people in it.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text warns about the ease of transmission of an infection (likely referring to a disease like HPV or fungal infection) and advises caution when getting nail services. It uses informal language but does not target or mock any individual or group. The tone is cautionary and informative, without derogatory intent, slurs, or implicit toxicity."

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The phrase 'so ghê' is common Vietnamese slang expressing mild surprise or admiration, similar to 'so intense' or 'so awesome' in a casual context. It contains no insults, profanity, targeted attacks, or culturally demeaning implications. The tone is neutral and not directed at any individual or group.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'so ghê' (literally 'so disgusting') is a strong negative expression that conveys intense disapproval or revulsion. While it may not target a specific individual or group, its tone is harsh and emotionally charged, introducing negativity and hostility into the discussion. The use of such a blunt and derogatory term qualifies as toxic language.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'so ghê' is a colloquial expression in Vietnamese that can mean 'so shocking', 'so intense', or 'so impressive', depending on context. It is often used neutrally or even positively to express surprise or astonishment. Without additional context indicating a target, sarcasm, or negative intent, this phrase alone does not convey toxicity. It lacks profanity, insults, or discriminatory implications."
