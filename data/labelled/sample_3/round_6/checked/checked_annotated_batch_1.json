It does not exhibit toxicity in literal meaning, cultural context, intent, or tone.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'hổ ăn 1 năm không hết thịt' is a Vietnamese idiom used to mock someone for being overweight or excessively large, implying they are so fat that even a tiger couldn't finish eating their meat in a year. This is a direct appearance-based insult, targeting an individual's physical attributes in a derogatory manner.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'hổ ăn 1 năm không hết thịt' literally means 'a tiger couldn't eat all the meat in a year,' which appears to be a metaphorical or exaggerated expression. Without context, it lacks a clear target or negative intent. It does not contain identifiable slurs, mockery, or toxic implications toward any individual or group. The statement is ambiguous and could be interpreted as hyperbolic praise or admiration rather than criticism or insult. Therefore, it is classified as non-toxic due to absence of clear harmful intent or cultural derogation.",

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The word 'đẹp' (beautiful) is used with laughing emojis (😂😂), which in Vietnamese online context typically indicates sarcasm or mockery, suggesting insincerity and ridiculing the subject's appearance or quality. This aligns with toxic behavior where superficially positive remarks convey contempt or negativity through implicit signals like emojis.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment consists of a simple compliment ('đẹp' meaning 'beautiful') accompanied by laughing emojis. There is no insult, mockery, or negative intent toward any individual or group. The tone is lighthearted and positive.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text 'đẹp 😂😂' literally means 'beautiful' or 'nice', and is likely used sarcastically or humorously given the laughing emojis. However, without context or a clear target, there is no identifiable insult, mockery of a group, or toxic intent. The phrase alone does not convey hostility, discrimination, or abuse. It remains at the level of ambiguous, casual expression, which is insufficient to classify as toxic.",

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The text uses '10 đỉm' (a phonetic approximation of '10 điểm' meaning '10 points'), but 'đỉm' is a deformation of 'điếm' (prostitute), turning the phrase into a derogatory insult. 'Ban nàkk' is also a mocking deformation of 'bạn nà' (this person), implying disrespect. The combination conveys a harsh, demeaning tone.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text '10 đỉm cho ban nàkk' appears to be a phonetic or stylized way of writing '10 điểm cho bạn nha', which is a friendly, playful expression often used to praise or compliment someone (similar to 'full marks for you'). The misspelling ('đỉm', 'nàkk') is likely for stylistic or affectionate emphasis, common in casual online Vietnamese speech. There is no insult, mockery, or negative intent detected.

It can be interpreted as a subtle insult or a way to express disapproval or contempt, especially if used in a confrontational or dismissive manner.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'không ngại à' (aren't you afraid?) is a neutral question that can vary in tone depending on context, but as a standalone comment, it lacks hostile intent, profanity, or targeted negativity.

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'bí phèo' is a phonetic deformation of 'Bình Phước,' a province in Vietnam, often used in a derogatory or mocking manner to stereotype people from that region. The term carries a negative connotation, implying backwardness or lack of sophistication, and is used to demean individuals or groups based on their regional origin.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "- 'bí phèo' là cách nói lái của 'bị phát, bị phe phẩy', mang ý mỉa mai, chế giễu, thường dùng để miêu tả người có tư tưởng cực đoan, bị coi là 'lệch lạc' hoặc 'ngu ngốc'.\n- Cụm 'định nghĩa này là bí phèo' mang tính xúc phạm, phủ nhận giá trị của định nghĩa một cách mỉa mai, thiếu tôn trọng.\n- Ngữ cảnh sử dụng teen-code/slang nhằm tăng tính châm biếm, thể hiện thái độ coi thường, không phải tranh luận xây dựng.\n→ Do đó, đây là ngôn ngữ độc hại dưới hình thức chế giễu, mỉa mai.",

There is no insult, mockery, or negative targeting of any individual or group. The emoji ':))' further reinforces the playful and non-toxic intent.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'giá như nhà nuôi lợn mà được tốt ntn' uses irony and the comparison to a pig ('lợn') to insult someone’s appearance or behavior, implying they resemble a pig in a derogatory way.

This constitutes name-calling targeting an individual, which is toxic behavior. The smiling emoji may indicate sarcasm or mockery, reinforcing the negative intent.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The term 'chuppy' is a derogatory slang deformation of 'chó Pug' (Pug dog), often used to mock someone's appearance, implying they look like a dog or are unattractive. The playful emoji 🙂 does not mitigate the insulting intent, as it is used sarcastically to soften the mockery rather than express genuine friendliness. The comment targets an individual with a personal attack on their looks.",

        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "Although the comment appears neutral on the surface, '🐷' (pig) is often used in Vietnamese online contexts as a derogatory nickname for someone perceived as greedy, lazy, or unclean. Requesting 'cách nuôi' (how to raise) implies treating a person like an animal, which is dehumanizing.

The intent is to mock or belittle, making it toxic.",
