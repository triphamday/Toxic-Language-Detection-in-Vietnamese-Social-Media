        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The word 'hong' (a slang/teen-code deformation of 'không') is combined with the clown emoji 🤡, which is often used to mock or ridicule someone. The tone implies sarcasm or derision, making it toxic in this context.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'có hong' is a slang/vulgar deformation of 'có không', often used in a mocking or taunting tone. The clown emoji 🤡 intensifies the ridicule, implying the person is foolish or deserving of mockery. This combination is commonly used in a derisive context, especially toward someone perceived as naive or inferior, making it toxic due to its mocking and demeaning intent.",

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Câu nói 'cạn phước lắm mới gặp page này mãi' là một lời than phiền nhẹ nhàng, mang tính chủ quan về việc không muốn bắt gặp một trang cụ thể. Mặc dù có ý tiêu cực (bực bội, không thích), nó không chứa ngôn ngữ lăng mạ, công kích cá nhân/ nhóm, kỳ thị, đe dọa, hay có ẩn ý chế giễu độc hại. Cách diễn đạt này phổ biến trong văn nói tiếng Việt để bày tỏ sự khó chịu ở mức độ nhẹ, không vượt quá ngưỡng được coi là độc hại.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'cạn phước' (exhausted luck/blessing) is a culturally loaded expression often used sarcastically or negatively to imply that someone is unlucky or undeserving. When combined with 'mới gặp page này mãi' (only now encountering this page after so long), it conveys a dismissive or mocking tone toward the page or its content. The implication is that the speaker views the page as unworthy or that encountering it is a misfortune, which introduces hostility and negativity.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'cạn phước lắm mới gặp page này mãi' uses idiomatic expression 'cạn phước' (run out of luck/merit) in a hyperbolic and humorous way to express frustration or irony about encountering the page after a long time. It does not target any individual or group with disrespect, insult, or discriminatory intent. The tone is colloquial and exasperated but not abusive or hostile, falling within common Vietnamese expressive speech without crossing into toxicity.",

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'ựa ựa' is a Vietnamese onomatopoeia mimicking the sound of vomiting, often used to express strong disgust or contempt. When directed at a person ('khang nguyễn'), it constitutes a direct, demeaning insult, implying revulsion toward the individual. This is a clear example of toxic language due to its hostile and disrespectful tone.",

The phrase 'mình k giải thích làm gì :))' further reinforces a mocking or belittling attitude, suggesting the speaker is unwilling to engage in constructive discussion. The emoji ':))' adds sarcasm, making the overall tone disrespectful and toxic.",

The phrase 'sợ tuyệt chủng' (afraid of extinction) could be interpreted in various contexts, but without additional context indicating discrimination, insults, or hate speech, it remains ambiguous. The laughing emojis suggest a humorous or dismissive tone, but not necessarily toxic mockery. Overall, the comment lacks explicit or implicit toxicity as defined.",

While not explicitly insulting, the phrasing implies ridicule toward a group or individual's concerns (e.g., fear of 'extinction'), which can be interpreted as belittling or demeaning.
