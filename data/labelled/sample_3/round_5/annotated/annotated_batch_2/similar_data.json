        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Văn bản sử dụng sự mỉa mai khi kết hợp 'hạnh phúc' với 'tang gia' (gia đình có tang), thể hiện sự thiếu tôn trọng và coi thường cảm xúc đau buồn trong văn hóa Việt, tạo ra sự tiêu cực và không phù hợp với ngữ cảnh trang trọng của việc tang lễ.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'hạnh phúc 1 tang gia' is a sarcastic twist on the title of a famous Vietnamese literary work ('Số Đỏ' by Vũ Trọng Phụng), where 'hạnh phúc của một tang gia' (happiness of a funeral family) mocks the hypocrisy and moral decay of a family celebrating a death for personal gain. Here, the comment distorts it further into a mocking or cynical remark, implying that someone is deriving inappropriate joy or benefit from a tragic or solemn event (e.g., a funeral). The tone is disrespectful and emotionally negative, targeting the subject of the comment with implicit ridicule.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "‘Tang gia’ (funeral) là nơi buồn bã, mất mát; ghép với ‘hạnh phúc’ tạo thành nghịch lý mang tính chế giễu, thể hiện sự thiếu tôn trọng đối với nỗi đau của người khác. Ngữ cảnh này cho thấy thái độ mỉa mai, vô cảm, có thể nhằm nhạo báng hoàn cảnh khó khăn của người hoặc nhóm bị nhắc đến."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses a dismissive and mocking tone to criticize someone's appearance or gender expression ('nam chả ra nam nữ chả ra nữ'), implying they do not conform to traditional gender norms.

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'cười miễn cưỡng hat' is a playful and informal expression, often used in a lighthearted or teasing context. 'Cười miễn cưỡng' means 'forced laughter,' and 'hat' is a phonetic approximation of 'hả?' (a casual way to ask 'right?'). It does not contain insults, mockery, or hostility toward any individual or group. The tone is more humorous or sarcastic in a non-malicious way.",
