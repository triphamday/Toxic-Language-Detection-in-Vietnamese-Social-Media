The clown emoji 🤡 can imply sarcasm or mockery, but without any specific target, subject, or accompanying toxic content in the text, the statement by itself does not constitute harsh, abusive, discriminatory, or threatening language. It is an incomplete expression with a playful or teasing tone, but not overtly toxic.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses the word 'hong' (a phonetic approximation of 'hông' or 'không') combined with the clown emoji 🤡, which is often used to mock or ridicule someone. The tone is dismissive and derogatory, implying the target is foolish or laughable.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The word 'hong' is a phonetic distortion of 'không', often used mockingly. Combined with the clown emoji 🤡, it creates a tone of ridicule and derision, implying the target is foolish or absurd. This is a common pattern in toxic teen-code to belittle others.",

The excessive use of heart emojis (❤❤❤❤❤) adds a sarcastic or mocking tone, reinforcing the toxicity toward the LGBTQ+ community.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'trai co trung sao' (boy with loyalty?) is a neutral or slightly affectionate inquiry about a man's faithfulness, possibly in a romantic context.

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'cạn phước lắm mới gặp page này mãi' is a playful and exaggerated expression of gratitude or luck, meaning 'I must be out of luck to finally find this page.'

In Vietnamese cultural context, 'phước' (merit/blessing) is a deeply rooted concept tied to karma and fortune; saying one has 'cạn phước' (run out of blessing) to explain a negative experience carries strong emotional negativity and contempt toward the page.

The phrasing suggests belittlement or contempt, particularly in the context of Vietnamese online discourse where such expressions can carry derogatory undertones. The abrupt negation ('ko còn sau đó nữa') adds a sarcastic or demeaning nuance.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text 'thái lan sau đó….. à ko còn sau đó nữa' appears to be a fragmented or incomplete statement, possibly referencing something related to Thailand in a vague way.

This is a direct, emotionally negative insult targeting an individual.",

The intent is positive and encouraging, aligning with non-toxic communication.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment appears to be a backhanded compliment with a sarcastic and dismissive tone. The phrase 'chúc mừng em đã tìm thấy hạnh phúc' (congratulations on finding happiness) is followed by a cynical remark 'còn thời gian được bao lâu, thì kệ đi em à' (how long will it last, just let it be). This implies skepticism or mockery toward the person's happiness, introducing negativity and emotional hostility.",

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "Câu nói 'chửi văn minh chuẩn 🤣' chứa từ 'chửi' (mắng, xúc phạm) là hành động giao tiếp tiêu cực. Dù có từ 'văn minh', nó vẫn cổ xúy hoặc tán thưởng việc chửi mắng, khiến hành vi này trở nên 'hợp lý hóa' hoặc đáng cười (thể hiện qua emoji 🤣). Ngữ điệu mỉa mai/chế giễu này tạo ra sự bình thường hóa và lan tỏa năng lượng tiêu cực, thù địch, làm suy giảm chất lượng giao tiếp.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'chửi văn minh chuẩn' uses the word 'chửi' (swearing/cursing) in a seemingly positive or approving context ('văn minh chuẩn' - standard civilized), which is sarcastic and mocking. The laughing emoji 🤣 reinforces the mockery, implying that the act of swearing is being celebrated in a derogatory way. This promotes a negative and disrespectful tone.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The phrase 'chửi văn minh chuẩn' is an ironic or humorous comment, likely referring to the idea of insulting someone in a polite or clever way. The laughter emoji 🤣 suggests amusement rather than directed hostility. It does not target any individual or group with toxic language, and in Vietnamese online culture, this kind of expression is often used playfully among peers without intent to harm.",
