This constitutes name-calling, blaming, and promotes hostility, fitting the definition of toxic language.",

        "toxicity_deepseek_reason": "The comment identifies the speaker as a soldier and implies a dismissive or negative stance towards parishioners and priests ('giáo dân và linh mục'), suggesting authority-based criticism that disrespects religious groups and introduces hostility, aligning with implicit toxicity in cultural context.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses the term 'gáo dân' (a derogatory slur for Catholics, implying blind or foolish followers) and contrasts it with 'lính tơi' (a self-deprecating but neutral term for a soldier). The phrasing implies a dismissive or mocking attitude toward Catholics and clergy, reinforcing negative stereotypes about religious groups. The tone is disrespectful and perpetuates division.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The text uses distorted and mocking language ('lính tơi', 'gáo dân') as phonetic parodies of 'linh mục' (priest) and 'giáo dân' (congregant), which are terms in the Catholic Church. This kind of deformation is commonly used in online contexts to mock or belittle religious figures and believers in Vietnamese internet culture. The phrase 'tôi là lính tơi nói ở mới nên gáo dân và linh mục không' appears nonsensical but carries an implicit tone of ridicule toward religious identity and speech, especially with the use of absurd phonetic substitutions. This constitutes indirect religious mockery, falling under toxic speech as it derides a religious group using slang and distortion."

        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The phrase 'đoạ rúc' is a derogatory deformation of 'đồ rác' (trash), used as a harsh insult. 'Húp' (slang for 'like' or 'admire') combined with the mocking tone and excessive punctuation (',,,') implies sarcastic ridicule toward 'Thái Minh' (likely a public figure or individual). The exaggerated 'yêu quá cơ' (love so much) further intensifies the mockery, making the comment toxic.",

The phrase 'yêu quá cơ' adds a sarcastic, mocking tone. Together, this appears to ridicule an individual using implicit, sexually suggestive language, common in online Vietnamese toxicity."

Ngữ cảnh 'à vậy à' mang tính châm biếm, kết hợp với từ lái 'cúng vườn' (biến thể của 'cúng giỗ', 'thờ cúng') cho thấy sự coi thường niềm tin tôn giáo hoặc phong tục tâm linh.

The phrase 'phật tử u mê' (deluded followers) looks down on believers as ignorant.

This reductive framing dismisses and trivializes religious beliefs, particularly Christianity, by placing them under a national myth in a way that undermines their sacredness, which constitutes religious insensitivity and disrespect."

This dismisses and ridicules religious faith, introducing hostility toward a specific group (religious believers).",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "The statement sarcastically implies that people should thank God instead of recognizing scientific facts (plants producing oxygen via photosynthesis), mocking scientific understanding and indirectly criticizing religious attribution of natural processes.
