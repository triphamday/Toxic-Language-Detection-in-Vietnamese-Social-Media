Cách diễn đạt này nhằm hạ thấp, chê bai đối tượng một cách tiêu cực, tạo ra sự chế nhạo chứ không mang tính chất trao đổi xây dựng.",
        "toxicity_mistral_reason": "The comment uses 'chuppy' (a phonetic approximation of 'chó puppy' or 'chó con'), which can be a derogatory term to mock someone as a dog or inferior. The phrase 'ăn cho lắm r bảo chuppy thua' implies that the person eats so much that even a puppy would lose to them, which is an indirect insult targeting their eating habits or appearance (e.g., implying gluttony or obesity). The tone is mocking and demeaning.",

The contrast with 'người không may mắn bị bệnh hay khuyết tật' frames obesity not as a health issue but as a moral failing or joke, showing lack of empathy and reinforcing negative stereotypes.
