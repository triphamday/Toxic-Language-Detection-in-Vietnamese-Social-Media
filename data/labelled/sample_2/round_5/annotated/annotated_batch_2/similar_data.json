Phrases like 'mẹ nào,' 'chơi les,' and the sarcastic questions ('bộ giới tính linh loạt à,' 'hay cú sốc chia tay nên quay ra chơi đàn bà cho bõ tức') convey judgment, ridicule, and negative stereotypes about bisexuality or fluid sexuality.

The winking emoji 😜 does not fully neutralize the underlying regional reference, which can carry negative connotations in Vietnamese cultural context.",
        "toxicity_qwen_reason": "‘namkiky’ là cách viết biến dạng, chế giễu từ ‘Nam Kỳ’, thường được dùng với hàm ý miệt thị vùng miền, đặc biệt trong bối cảnh phân biệt Bắc-Nam. Kèm theo biểu tượng cảm xúc 😜 (trêu cợt), cho thấy thái độ chế giễu hơn là nhắc nhở tích cực. Dù có vẻ như đang nói ‘không được phân biệt’, nhưng việc sử dụng từ này thể hiện sự khơi lại định kiến vùng miền một cách mỉa mai, gây chia rẽ."
