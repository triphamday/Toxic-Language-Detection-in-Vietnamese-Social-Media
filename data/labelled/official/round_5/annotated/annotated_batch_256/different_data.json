It lists negative behaviors (e.g., 'siêng ăn lười làm', 'tà dâm ngoại tình', 'ăn mặc khơi gợi dâm dục') and attributes them to poor morality.\n    - **Cultural & Social Context**: While the criticism targets systemic issues, the language is sweeping and judgmental, using terms like 'tà dâm' (lewdness) and 'dâm dục' (lust) in a condemnatory tone.\n    - **Intent & Target**: Though not directly attacking an individual, the comment generalizes and stigmatizes groups (e.g., 'sgbb'—implied as Southern Vietnamese youth or urban dwellers) with broad, negative stereotypes.\n    - **Tone & Implicit Signals**: The tone is harsh and morally absolutist, framing behaviors as universally degenerate without nuance.
